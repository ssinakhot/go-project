# Golang Project Setup

This is just a golang template setup to quickly get developing rather than focus on finding libraries to support development.

This project uses .env files to load settings with the https://github.com/joho/godotenv library. A popular alternative would be https://github.com/spf13/viper.

This project uses a cli library with https://github.com/urfave/cli. A popular alternative would be https://github.com/spf13/cobra.

This project uses a logger library with https://github.com/rs/zerolog.
